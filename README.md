HR Analytics Dashboard (Power BI + SQL)

What’s this project about?

I built an interactive HR dashboard using Power BI and SQL to turn messy Excel data into clear, actionable insights about a company’s workforce. It helps answer real questions like:

Where are we losing employees?
Is our workforce diverse enough?
Which departments are growing or struggling?

Cool Things You’ll Find Here:

✔ Who works here?
Nearly 75% of employees work remotely—big shift from traditional offices!

Gender split: ~9.3K men, ~8.5K women, and a small but important non-conforming group (500).
The largest age group? 31–40-year-olds (5,100 employees).

✔ Who’s staying (or leaving)?
Average employee sticks around for 8 years—pretty loyal!
But turnover rates show some departments might need better retention strategies.

✔ Hiring wins:
Some teams saw hiring spikes (up to 96% growth!), showing where recruitment nailed it.

Why It Matters:
HR teams waste hours digging through spreadsheets. This dashboard gives them one clear place to:
Spot diversity gaps.
Fix departments with high turnover.
Plan hiring based on real trends, not guesses.

How I Built It:
SQL: Cleaned and queried the raw data.
Power BI: Made it visual and interactive (charts, filters, etc.).
